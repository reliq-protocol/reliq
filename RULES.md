Track Brief

Build the best application that uses BITE v2 (Blockchain Integrated Threshold Encryption) to enable conditional transactions — where sensitive transaction details remain encrypted and are only revealed/executed when a condition is satisfied. The emphasis is on proving a real “why private + conditional” workflow that cannot be done well with standard public execution.

Required components (must-have)

Uses BITE v2 in a way that materially changes the workflow (not just “privacy as a tagline”)

Demonstrates a conditional trigger (e.g., decrypt/execute only when condition(s) are met)

Shows encrypted → condition check → decrypt/execute → receipt (or equivalent trace)

What “excellent” looks like (win conditions)

Clear why the condition and encryption matter (prevents leakage, front-running, or premature disclosure)

A clean, auditable lifecycle:policy/condition definition → encrypted intent → execution → receipt/logs

Strong UX and trust model:“What is private?” “When does it unlock?” “Who can trigger?” “What happens if it fails?”

Demonstrates a realistic commerce-grade use case with guardrails (limits, allowlists, human approval if needed)

Example project ideas

Conditional payment: escrow-like payment released only when delivery proof/attestation is present

Private quote / private bidding: hidden amount/terms until the counterparty accepts

Policy-based execution: agent can transact only within encrypted constraints (spend caps, allowlists)

Private procurement: agent buys data/services without broadcasting strategy/inputs until finality

Conditional subscription renewal: renew only if SLA metrics are met (otherwise auto-cancel)

Submission requirements

Demo video showing the conditional flow end-to-end (encrypted → trigger → execution)

Evidence of BITE v2 usage (logs/trace/screenshots and a short explanation)

Clear description of:what stays encrypted

what condition unlocks execution

how failure is handled

Receipt output (UI or structured log) showing what executed and why
